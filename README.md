If you prefer using dictionaries to manage a car rental system, you can simplify the data management by utilizing dictionaries to store information about cars and their rental status. Here’s a basic implementation of a car rental system using dictionaries in Python.

Basic Structure
1.Data Storage

Use dictionaries to store car information and rental status.
2.Operations

List available cars.
Rent a car.
Return a car.
Explanation

1.Data Storage:
self.cars is a dictionary where each key is a car’s registration number and each value is another dictionary containing car details (make, model, year, and availability).
self.rented_cars tracks cars that are currently rented out.

2.Operations:
add_car adds a new car to the system.
list_available_cars returns a dictionary of cars that are available.
rent_car changes the availability status of a car and adds it to the rented cars dictionary.
return_car updates the availability status and removes the car from the rented cars dictionary.
This implementation uses dictionaries to manage the state and operations of the car rental system. It's simple and effective for a basic car rental application and can be expanded with additional features and error handling as needed.
